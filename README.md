# SheepLogger

SheepLogger is an application developed as part of a masters thesis at NTNU, IDI.

The app is meant to be used by sheep farmers and shepherds when conducting supervision trips. It lets the user store data about trips and observations. 
The data can later be exported from the application and used in rapports for the government.
